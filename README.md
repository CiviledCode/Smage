# Introduction
Smage is a simplistic but modernistic asynchronous game engine build on JavaFX for 2d applications. 
Right out of the box Smage has a few key advantages over other engines built in java:

* Simplicity that does not limit the developer to fully control their applications
* Standalone game logic and object handling
* Multilayered scene systems
* Mobile and Desktop support using a fork of gluonhq's JavaFX port
* Scalability for non semetrical projects

# Why do we need another Java game engine?
I originally had the vision of creating Smage to give developers using Bukkit, Nukkit, Spigot, and Pocketmine an easy transition into making projects and games for themselves.
Most 2D Java game engines take an approach that makes the developers initialize and work through setting up their windows inside of their Main methods. With Smage, that is already handled and it follows an easy to understand architecture for anybody to learn.
Spend less time working on the technical aspect of the game, and more time building your project! Additionally, it's a great learning experience for new and experienced developers to dive into the fundamentals of how games work and the process in creating industry level titles such as Minecraft, Tetris, Terraria, etc.

# How do I use Smage?
Refer to the Wiki and follow along with the code inside of the Example branch to understand the API and it's fundamental pieces!

# How can I contribute?
Create a Pull request and I will look into it! This project is currently maintained by my good friend and I, so the more contributions the better!
